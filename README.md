# Temperature-Humidity-Reader
•Designed a temperature and humidity monitoring system incorporating the DHT11 sensor and IC chips
•Utilized C and assembly language to program the ATMEGA 328P microcontroller and retrieve relative humidity and temperature data as binary numbers
•Created a 3D model design and printed the necessary hardware components to accurately read and display the temperature and humidity values
